Spring Boot REST API for managing tour

# Connecting to a database
##H2 (In memory)
When running the application using the 'dev' profile, the application uses 
an in memory H2 database  - the schema for which is automatically generated by Hibernate.
Data for this app is automatically populated on start-up by the data-h2.sql script.

##Postgres 
When running the application without a profile, the application uses
a local instance of a postgres database, running on port 5432. This assumes 
a database called 'Tournament_Data' has been created and the appropriate schema
tables/sequences/constraints/users prior to the app starting - or it will fail to do so.
This database and schema can be created using the following SQL files in resources/manual_sql:

- 1.create_db.sql: This will create the Tournament_Data database
- 2.create_Schema.sql: This will create the tables, foreign keys, users and privileges 
(MUST be run whilst connected to the "Tournament_Data" db)
- 3.populate_postgres_db.sql: This will populate the tables with test data.

Run all of the above as the postgres (admin) user! The application itself runs
as app_user, which has limited access to select, update, insert and delete into the
schema.
